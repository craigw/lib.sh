# lib.sh

Every time I do soemthing in Bash I wish for a few of the things I've already
written.

So, here they are.

## Installing

```
sudo make install
```

## Using

```
. ~/lib/common.sh

log_info "Running the things..."
```

## Supported Environments

Well, I run it on OSX on my laptop, so... the version of OSX current on my
laptop is about it.

I'd love pull requests though!
